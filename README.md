### Introduction to Git and GitHub

#### Git
- **Purpose**: Primarily used for version control of projects, helping in tracking changes and managing different versions of a project over time.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Repository (Repo)**: A storage location for your project files and their version history.

#### GitHub
- **Purpose**: A platform for hosting Git repositories, facilitating collaboration and sharing of code with others.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Collaboration**: Allows multiple contributors to work on the same project simultaneously.
  - **Pull Requests**: A mechanism for reviewing and discussing proposed changes before merging them into the main branch.

### Basic Git Workflow

1. **Add**: Adds changes in the working directory to the staging area.
   ```bash
   git add <file>
   ```
2. **Stage**: Prepares the changes to be committed.
   - The `git add` command is used to stage changes.
3. **Commit**: Records the changes in the repository with a descriptive message.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

### Ignoring Files

- **.gitignore**: A file where you specify which files or directories to ignore in a project. Useful for excluding files that are not meant to be shared (e.g., configuration files, compiled binaries).

### Viewing History

- **git log**: Shows the commit history for the repository, including commit IDs, messages, and timestamps.

### Branching and Merging

- **Branching**: Allows you to diverge from the main codebase to work on different features or bug fixes independently.
  ```bash
  git branch <branch_name>
  git checkout <branch_name>
  ```
- **Merging**: Combines changes from different branches.
  - **Fast Forward Merge**: A simple merge where the branch pointer is moved forward.
  - **Three Way Merge**: A more complex merge that creates a new commit to combine changes.

### Advanced Git Concepts

1. **Stash**: Temporarily saves changes that are not ready to be committed, allowing you to work on something else.
   ```bash
   git stash
   git stash pop
   ```
2. **Clone**: Creates a copy of an existing repository from a remote source.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
3. **Fetch**: Downloads updates from a remote repository but doesnâ€™t merge them.
   ```bash
   git fetch
   ```
4. **Merge**: Integrates changes from different branches.
   ```bash
   git merge <branch_name>
   ```
5. **Pull**: Combines `fetch` and `merge` in one step, updating the local branch with changes from the remote branch.
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

### Recap of Different Merging Techniques

- **Fast Forward Merge**: Used when there are no changes in the target branch since it diverged from the source branch.
- **Three Way Merge**: Used when both branches have made independent changes. It uses a common ancestor to merge changes.

### Additional Tips

- **Regular Commits**: Make frequent, small commits with descriptive messages to keep track of your progress.
- **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive names for branches to indicate the feature or fix being worked on (e.g., `feature/add-login`, `bugfix/fix-navbar`).
- **Collaboration**: Use pull requests and code reviews to ensure high code quality and collaboration.
